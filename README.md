# **MySQL_Fundamentals**

##  Project Overview

This  project is designed to build a solid foundation in **SQL** using **MySQL**. It walks through real-world scenarios where key SQL concepts are applied to analyze data and understand relational database systems.

##  Key Objectives Covered

- Master the "Big 6" SQL components:  
  `SELECT`, `FROM`, `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `HAVING`, `ORDER BY`.
- Use aggregate functions:  
  `SUM`, `AVG`, `MAX`, `MIN`, `COUNT`, `COUNT DISTINCT`.

##  What I Learned

- Writing clean, efficient SQL queries for real datasets.
- The importance of query order and syntax in MySQL.
- How grouping, filtering, and sorting work together to extract insights.
- Joining data across multiple tables for deeper analysis.
- Reinforced the difference between writing SQL to explore vs. explain data.
